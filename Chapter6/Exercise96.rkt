(define-struct tank [loc vel])
; A Tank is a structure:
;   (make-tank Number Number). 
; interpretation (make-tank x dx) specifies the position:
; (x, HEIGHT) and the tank's speed: dx pixels/tick 
 
; A Missile is a Posn. 
; interpretation (make-posn x y) is the missile's place

; A SIGS is one of: 
; â€“ (make-aim UFO Tank)
; â€“ (make-fired UFO Tank Missile)
; interpretation represents the complete state of a 
; space invader game





; SIGS -> Image
; renders the given game state on top of BACKGROUND
